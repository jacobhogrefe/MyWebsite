<!-- The about page is your chance to talk about yourself. On here, give a brief description of your schooling and what got you 
into the computer science field, your current experience, your interests, and anything else you would like to add (favorite artist, zodiac sign, 
anything you’d like!). Please include some photos from your life to show who you are! You must include picture of yourself. 
Also I highly recommend adding picture of your pets if you have any – interviewers love to see pets...and more importantly, I love to see pets. -->
