            <p>
                My name is Jacob Hogrefe, and I am currently a junior Computer Science major at Quinnipiac University.
                I am from CT, and I 
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in computers came from a young age where I took my toys apart to see how they worked. 
                As you could maybe assume, many did not go back together properly. However, it ignited something 
                in me to learn how things I don't understand, work. As I've grown up, I've become more intrigued 
                on how the technology we use everyday functions both at a hardware and software level. And my love 
                for math drove me to have a knack for problem solving, and makes coding enjoyable for me. As such 
                I am always driven to write the best code possible, while also being conscious of making it understandable.
