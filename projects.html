<!-- The projects page is where you are going to link to some of your GitHub projects and write a description of them 
(what did you make, what language did you use, anything interesting/challenging about it, etc.). I would assume most of you wonâ€™t 
have many projects on GitHub since you are in a Git class currently, so go ahead and create repos and push code up for the projects you are proudest of. 
Please include at least two projects. -->
